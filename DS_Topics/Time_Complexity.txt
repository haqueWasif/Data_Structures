// Time Complexity -> Measurement of how efficient an alogorithm is compared to other algorithm

// It is not measured by execution time for different devices like a code running in a low spec pc or a code running in high spec pc

// It is measured by the Big O notation which is O(steps)
// Rules for calulating time complexity
/*
    1. Always calculate for worst case
    2. Ignore the constants
*/

// Complexity is calculated for loops, recursion which is also a type of loop. For any variable declaration or any code not involving loop complexity is O(1)

// When we do not know the complexity we usually write it like this O(n + m + x + z)


// How time is calculated from time complexity
// Maximum server in online judge does 10^8 operations in 1 sec we generally approximate it to 10^7 operations since some servers might take less

// if N = 10^7 then O(N) i.e O(10^7) means program is of 1 sec
// if N = 10^8 then O(N) means program is of 10 sec
